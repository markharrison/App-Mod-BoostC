Create the Azure resources needed for a generative AI chat interface.

This includes Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search (formerly Cognitive Search). Use the managed identity created earlier so all these services can authenticate with each other securely without API keys.

Cost considerations:
- Use S0 (low cost) SKUs where possible for Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Services
- Always use the "GPT-4o" model deployed in Sweden Central (this region has better quota availability for proof-of-concept projects)
- Even if the main resource group is in UK South, the Azure OpenAI instance should be in Sweden Central
- Use a capacity of 8 for the model deployment:

      sku: {
          name: 'Standard'
          capacity: 8
      }

Important naming rules:
- Azure OpenAI and AI Search resource names must be lowercase
- The uniqueString() function can generate uppercase characters, so apply toLower() to the generated names
- This avoids the error: "Azure OpenAI requires the customSubDomainName property to be lowercase"

Store the configuration for these resources (endpoints, model names) in a GenAISettings configuration section.

Role assignments require the Principal ID (a GUID that identifies the managed identity), not the resource ID. You'll need to:
1. Output the principalId from app-service.bicep
2. Pass it to genai.bicep
3. Use it when creating role assignments for "Cognitive Services OpenAI User" and similar roles
