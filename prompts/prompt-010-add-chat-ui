Create a chat interface in a new folder called "chatui" that lets users interact with the database using natural language.

The chat should:
- Connect to the Azure GenAI resources (OpenAI and AI Search) configured earlier
- Use the application's APIs to read and write data - never query the database directly
- Apply the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern using any contextual information in the RAG folder

If you need additional Azure resources for RAG, use the lowest cost development SKUs (preferably S0).

When the chat displays lists from the database, format them nicely within the chat bubble. Since the list appears inside a chat message, follow this approach:

1. **Escape HTML first** - Convert special characters (<, >, &) to HTML entities to prevent security issues and stop raw HTML from displaying as text

2. **Then apply formatting** - After escaping, convert markdown-style syntax to HTML:
   - `**text**` becomes `<strong>text</strong>` for bold
   - Lines starting with `1.` become ordered lists (`<ol><li>`)
   - Lines starting with `-` or `*` become bullet lists (`<ul><li>`)
   - `\n` becomes `<br>` for line breaks

3. **Use innerHTML, not textContent** - So the formatted HTML actually renders as styled elements instead of showing the raw tags

Without this approach, you'll see raw HTML tags like `<li>Item</li>` displayed as plain text instead of actual formatted lists.
