Return dummy data instead of connecting to the database. This is useful for testing or when the database isn't available.

When creating test dates, be careful about date format confusion between UK (day/month) and US (month/day) formats. To avoid this:

- Keep both month and day values below 13 (e.g., use day 5 of month 3, not day 15 of month 12)
- Better yet, calculate dates relative to today using DateTime.Now.AddDays(-x) instead of hardcoding specific dates

This prevents bugs where dates like "12/03/2023" display differently depending on regional settings.
