Create a simple architecture diagram showing all the Azure services that get deployed when the scripts are run.

The diagram should show how the services connect to each other - for example, how the App Service connects to SQL Database using the managed identity, and how it connects to Azure OpenAI for the chat functionality.

Keep it simple and readable - this helps people understand the overall solution at a glance.
