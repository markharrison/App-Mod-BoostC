Create all the API endpoints needed to support the functionality shown in the screenshots. The application code should use these APIs rather than accessing the database directly.

Include Swagger documentation so developers can see all available endpoints and test them interactively through the Swagger UI.

Both the main application and the chat interface must interact with the database through these APIs - they should never query the database directly. This keeps the data access layer centralised and maintainable.
