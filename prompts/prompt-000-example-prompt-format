This is an example showing how prompt files should be named and structured.

Naming convention: prompt-00X-three-word-description

Choose three words that describe what the prompt does. For example:
- prompt-001-create-app-bicep - for creating App Service infrastructure
- prompt-002-create-azure-sql - for creating SQL database infrastructure

The coding agent reads and executes all prompts listed in the prompt-order file, so make sure your new prompt is added there.
