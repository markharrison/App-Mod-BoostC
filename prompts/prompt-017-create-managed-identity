Create a user-assigned managed identity for the application to use when connecting to Azure SQL and other Azure services.

Name it something like mid-AppModAssist-[timestamp] where the timestamp makes it unique (e.g., including day, hour, and minute).

This identity will be assigned to the App Service so it can authenticate to Azure SQL without storing any passwords or connection secrets.

Note: With user-assigned managed identities, the principalId isn't directly on the identity object - it's nested under properties. Be careful when trying to output this value in Bicep.

Save the Bicep file as `deploy-infra/modules/managed-identity.bicep` and ensure it can be called from `deploy-infra/main.bicep`.

The managed identity must be created early in the deployment process because both the App Service and SQL Server need to reference it.
