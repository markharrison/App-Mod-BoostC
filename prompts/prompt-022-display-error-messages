Add graceful error handling so the application still works (with dummy data) when the database connection fails.

When errors occur, display them prominently in a header bar at the top of the page. Include:
- A clear description of what went wrong
- The file and line number where the error occurred (but don't show the actual code)
- For managed identity errors, provide specific guidance on how to fix them

This helps users troubleshoot without exposing sensitive code details.

Common managed identity issues to explain:
- Missing AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variable
- Connection string without the User Id parameter
- Managed identity not granted database permissions
- Wrong identity type (system-assigned vs user-assigned confusion)
